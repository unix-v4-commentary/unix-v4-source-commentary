\Large\textbf{The UNIX Fourth Edition Source Code Commentary}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

In 1974, a magnetic tape containing UNIX Fourth Edition was sent from Bell Labs to the University of Utah. Fifty years later, it was rediscovered in a storage closet---the only surviving copy of the first UNIX written in C.

This book is a complete guide to that code.

At just 10,000 lines, UNIX v4 is small enough for one person to understand completely---yet it contains a fully functional operating system with multiprocessing, a hierarchical filesystem, device drivers, and a shell. Every concept that defines modern computing is here, in its purest form.

\textbf{What you'll learn:}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item How an operating system boots and initializes itself
\item How processes are created, scheduled, and terminated
\item How the filesystem stores and retrieves data
\item How system calls bridge user programs and the kernel
\item How device drivers interface hardware to software
\item How the shell parses and executes commands
\item How the C compiler transforms source into machine code
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who this book is for:}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Systems programmers who want to understand operating systems at the deepest level
\item Computer science students seeking a comprehensible, complete OS to study
\item Historians of computing exploring UNIX's origins
\item Anyone curious how 10,000 lines of code changed the world
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

The code is elegant. The design is timeless. The ideas are foundational.
